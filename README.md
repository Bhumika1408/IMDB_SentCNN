Welcome to 🍿 IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🎬! This project aims to classify IMDb movie reviews as either positive or negative using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs.

## 🚀 Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we leverage the power of CNNs to analyze IMDb movie reviews and predict their sentiment. By understanding audience reactions to movies, this analysis provides valuable insights for filmmakers and audiences alike.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 📊 Dataset
We use the IMDb movie reviews dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset in natural language processing. The dataset contains a large collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

### 🧠 Model Architecture
Our CNN-based model consists of the following layers:
- Embedding layer to convert word indices into dense vectors.
- Convolutional layer to extract features from embedded word vectors.
- Max pooling layer to downsample the feature maps.
- Flatten layer to convert the 3D output to 2D.
- Fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation functions.
- Output layer with sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

### ⚙️ Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data. We use binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer for model training. The performance of the model is evaluated based on accuracy.
